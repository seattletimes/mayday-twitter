Mayday!
=======

This app uses the Twitter streaming API to track and display (in a map and a stream) selected Twitter users. At the Seattle Times, we're using it to respond to May Day festivities.

Running this app
----------------

While developing, you need two Bash shells. One to run Grunt, and another to run the ``index.js`` file that actually subscribes to the firehose. You'll also need to get access tokens from Twitter and load them into your ``auth.json`` file. Not for the faint of heart.
